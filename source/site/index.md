title: gMachina - A Ghost in the Machine
---

## What is this?
gMachina is a RESTFUL, API based game. The idea is to provide a centralized database to build and interact with. Imagine if you could send commands in the form of **GET** or **POST** requests to a Tamagotchi, with a dash of Neopets thrown in, and you would get something like gMachina.

### When is it out?
gMachina is currently still in early prototype stages. Right now there is no official release date, but the goal is to have the documentation and fully working API by late 2018, with the first game demonstrating how to act with the API shortly after.

### What technology is being used?
The game is being built in Python 3 and Django.

### How can I keep up with development?
